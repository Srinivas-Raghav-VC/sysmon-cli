That is the best question you could possibly ask. It shows you're thinking not just about the code, but about *how to learn*, which is a much more valuable skill. You are 100% right that just re-typing the same code isn't the best way to learn. That's passive. We need to make it active.

Here is a two-step plan that programmers use to move from "I understand this" to "I can build this."

### Step 1: The "Blank File" Challenge (The Active Version)

This is more than just re-doing the task. It's an active recall exercise, like trying to draw a map from memory.

1.  **State the Goal:** Open a completely blank `main.rs` file. Your goal is to write a program that sets up the terminal, creates a 2x2 layout, and then cleans up the terminal on quit. That's it.
2.  **The "Three Pillars" Method:** Don't try to remember every line. Instead, start by writing comments for the three main pillars of a TUI application:
    ```rust
    fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
        // --- Pillar 1: SETUP THE TERMINAL ---
        // What two or three things do I need to do to get the terminal ready?

        // --- Pillar 2: THE MAIN LOOP ---
        // How do I start a loop that runs forever?
        // Inside the loop, what are the two main jobs? (Drawing and Input)

        // --- Pillar 3: CLEANUP THE TERMINAL ---
        // How do I put the terminal back to normal?

        Ok(())
    }
    ```
3.  **Fill in the Blanks:** Now, try to fill in the code under each comment. **It is 100% okay to get stuck and look back at our original file.** The goal isn't to be perfect; the goal is the active process of trying, failing, and looking up the answer. That's what builds the connections in your brain.

### Step 2: The "Modification" Challenge

Once you can build the basic structure, the next step is to prove you understand it by changing it. This is where you really solidify the knowledge.

Try to do these small challenges:

  * **Layout:** Change the layout to have three vertical columns instead of a 2x2 grid.
  * **Input:** Make the program quit when you press the `Esc` key instead of 'q'.
  * **Styling:** Add a border to your ASCII art `Paragraph` and give the border a different color.

Doing these small, targeted modifications forces you to find the exact right line of code and understand what it does. Itâ€™s impossible to do this passively.

Doing things again isn't passive if you do it with a goal and without the original code in front of you. That struggle to remember is the feeling of learning happening.

Give that plan a shot when you're ready. And when you come back, we can bring the app to life by adding that live CPU data. How does that sound?
